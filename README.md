# PLP---Airplane-Simulation

# Overview The Airport Simulation System allows users to manage operations at an airport. This includes tasks such as adding and managing airplanes, assigning gates, boarding passengers, and simulating the flight process. The system is designed for airport staff to interact with and control various aspects of airport operations. The simulation demonstrates concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP), including managing different airport components like planes, gates, passengers, and flights.
